# Welcome to my profile 
Hi! I'm Emma, a Brazilian undergraduate in computer engineering. Keeping doing the same thing and learning nothing new is not my thing, so I like always to try new ways to solve the same problem as well as challenge myself.
Although I just finished only the first semester of college, I've been studying programming for a while. I'm passionate about how you can change someone's life with technology, and that's what drives me forward. Even if it's just code and math, I believe it's essential to always remember that the fundamental goal is developing technology for people.
